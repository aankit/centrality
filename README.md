centrality
==========

Generate poetry using Python and Wordnet. Find a more intuitive way to approach meaning. Built for Allison Parrish's class Reading and Writing Electronic Text at NYU-ITP.

Use the application [here](http://centrality.herokuapp.com)! Try reading the poems out loud and with others, its fun!
