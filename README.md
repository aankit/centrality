Built an application that generated poetry using lexicographic data and probability distributions. It took a verb as an input and generated a poem made up of its various meanings in an attempt to challenge you to find meaning on the edges, to appreciate the less common usages, and perhaps be inspired. 

When I asked renowned Academy Award winninng computer scientist Ken Perlin for a verb to generate him a poem, he gave me one I mispelled and couldn't generate a poem about. After hearing the output of a less obscure verb, he said it sounded like a spam email and walked away.

Built for Allison Parrish's class Reading and Writing Electronic Text at NYU-ITP.
